        See: paragraph 128 for details:
        In setting the href to resp. /#, /servers, /users the tabs on the web pages can now be clicked
        and the correct content is shown.
        However: now the complete app will be reloaded, i.e. restarted.
                  That means that the state of the application would be lost and it would slow down the performance.
        
        Instead routerlink is used. This directive is an Angular feature.
        This attribute will catch the select, prevent starting the default, parses it and

        routerLinkActive="active"
        - routerLinkActive is an Angular directive.
          - It analyses your currently loaded path and then checks which link leads to route which uses this path.
          - By default it marks the element as 'active' on which you are.
          - In the case below the empty path will be part of all paths and therefore will allways be marked active.
        - active is a css feature.
        - routerLinkActiveOptions="{exact: true}"
          - Tells Angular: only add this routerLink active class if the exact path is true.
            - This prevents 'Home' being marked as active too:
              - { path: '', component: HomeComponent}
              - { path: 'servers',Â component: ServersComponent}
              -> Normally both '' and 'servers' are on the path leading to the route.
                Sor both would be marked as active. {exact: true} prevents this.

        127. Setting up and Loading Routes.

        router-outlet is an Angular decorator. 
        Ref: 
        - https://angular.io/guide/router 
        - https://angular.io/api/router/RouterOutlet
        This will be the place where we will start the component of the currently selected router.
        This element informs Angular to update the application view with the component for the selected route.

        140. Setting up Child (Nested) Routes.
        
        THE <router-outlet> HERE IS RESERVED FOR THE TOP-LEVEL OF OUR ROUTES THAT HAVE NESTED ROUTES.
        So nested routes need a separate <router-outlet> element at the appropriate place where they will be used.
        In the case of servers: servers.component.html.
      -->
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
